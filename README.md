## Overview

The parking space detection system uses computer vision techniques to identify and monitor available parking spaces. The implementation is based on OpenCV for image processing and utilizes additional libraries for enhanced functionality.

## Libraries Used

1. **python-opencv (OpenCV):**
   - OpenCV is a powerful computer vision library used for image processing tasks.

2. **cvzone:**
   - cvzone provides additional functions and utilities for OpenCV, making it easier to work with computer vision applications.

3. **numpy:**
   - NumPy is used for efficient numerical operations and array manipulation, particularly in the context of image processing.

4. **pickle:**
   - Pickle is used for serialization and deserialization of Python objects, facilitating the storage of trained models or other data.

5. **other_library (if applicable):**
   - Include any other libraries specific to your project.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/libberaj/Parking-slot-prediction-and-booking-system.git
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Download Trained Models (if applicable):**

    ```bash
    # Include instructions if you have pre-trained models
    ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Parking Space Detection Script:**

    ```bash
    python parking_space_detection.py
    ```
